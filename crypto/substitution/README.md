## NAME: 
200 Hz

## DESC: 
We have built this special cipher. Can you break it and decrypt the flag?

## POINTS: 100

## Solution:
This is a substitution  cipher with a random mapping. We can take the encrypted sentence and put it into a frequency analysis tool like `https://www.dcode.fr/frequency-analysis` OR since we can provide input we can also put `a to z` and find the mapping and then find the flag. We can identify the flag since `{` and `}` are not affected by the substitution.
